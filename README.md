* Exchange one or more cards for one or more cards.
* Complete quests that have a prize as a reward. There are two ways to get quests:
    * Some quests will appear randomly (quote quote) to a selected group of players.
    * Other quests will be unlocked by winning a game.
    * General quests that have rigurous requisites which allow to unlock a rare card.

    * dark theme
* Buy avatar customization elements

    * e.g.:
        * see what cards a specific player has got
        * see what cards are possessed by a team / organization
        * see who has a particular card
## Ranking
Everyone will be able to see a ranking of the best players and organizations.
This ranking will be updated at the start of each week up until the 15th week.
There will be 5 different categories for the ranking:
1. Player
2. Career
3. Faculty
4. Official university clubs
5. Game Teams
### Rewards
#### Players
The top 10 players will receive rewards in the form of cards, which will range from common cards to exclusive limited edition cards.
#### Organizations
There will be a budget allocated for the organizations that will be distributed depending on their placement at the end of the semester.
#### Teams
Top-ranked teams will be given multipliers. This are special items that will allow to team to duplicate a reward. For example, if a team gets the special prize: change the final mark of a completed course, and they have five legendary multipliers, 6 team members will be able to get the reward (by using all five multipliers). That said, what about that legendary status? Because not all rewards are equally impactful, it is only sensible to have also different types of multipliers that will be applicable to a sub-range of the rewards. Specifically, multipliers have 5 different levels:
1. Legendary: applies to any reward.
2. Epic: applies to all rewards gained by using up until 10 cards.
3. Rare: applies to all rewards gained by using up until 7 cards.
4. Uncommon: applies to all rewards gained by using up until 4 cards.
5. Common: only applies to single-card rewards.
#### Career and faculty
Prices will be handed to representatives, in the form of more freedom to do events and they will be more events (games) targetted towards the subjects related to the best performing careers and faculties. Thus, belonging to a high-performing faculty or career gives you more opportunities to become a top performer.

## Joker
The joker is a special card which has no initial value. It is a game changer that will take any card's value but won't change it's value afterwards. That is to say, the joker is effectively a ticket to get any particular cards.
## King of Games
The player that stands at the top of the entire university will be granted that imponent title of "King of Games". This will bring multiple benefits, such as being able to register to any course that he has unlocked, even if there are no spots left. He will be able to borrow any book, overriding existing contracts, and also override study room reservations. On top of that, he will be able to set games and events, that is to say, actively participate in the development of up and coming activities inside of the game.
If that weren't enough, he will be granted a joker.
### Assignment
This title and it's perks will not be granted each week (as for the other ranking-related prizes), rather, it will be each 4 weeks, that is, at the middle and end of the term, that the title will be updated.
If someone were to maintain a top 1 placement, he will be given a number of jokers equal to the nth number of the fibonacci sequence, where n is the number of consecutive times he has been at the top 1 spot.
